<div align="center">
  <img height="80" alt="icon" src="https://github.com/vague-theme/vague/blob/main/assets/icon.png?raw=true" />
  <h1>Vague for Yazi</h1>
  <!-- Optional: add a preview screenshot here
  Use user-attachments instead of the assets/ folder to keep the repo minimal.
  Example:
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/..." alt="Preview" />
  Note: make sure to adjust image size if applicable

## Usage

Add the flavor.toml and tmtheme.xml files in ~/.config/yazi/flavors/vague.yazi/

The directory structure should be this:

~/.config/yazi/
├── flavors/
│   ├── vague.yazi/
└── theme.toml

To set it as your dark flavor, change the content of your `theme.toml` to:

```toml
[flavor]
dark = "vague"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.

See the [Yazi flavor documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview) for more details.
