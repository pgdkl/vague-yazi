## Usage

Add the flavor.toml and tmtheme.xml files in ~/.config/yazi/flavors/vague.yazi/

The directory structure should be this:

```
~/.config/yazi/
├── flavors/
│   ├── vague.yazi/
└── theme.toml
```

To set it as your dark flavor, change the content of your `theme.toml` to:

```toml
[flavor]
dark = "vague"
```

Make sure your `theme.toml` doesn't contain anything other than `[flavor]`, unless you want to override certain styles of this flavor.

See the [Yazi flavor documentation](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/flavors/overview) for more details.
